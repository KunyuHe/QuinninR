# Where Everything Starts

About Myself
---------------------------
Hello, world! This is Quinn He. I'm a current senior student at Nanjing University, China and I'll become a M.A. candidate in [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.sites.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, IL this fall. I study both economics and international relations. I'm interested in applied economic research in the field of education and environmental politics. 

I work with data, and I feel most comfortable working with *R* and *RStudio*. I'm currently working for [Netease Game](http://game.163.com/en/) as a data analyst and I'm also volunteering at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) as a student mentor for the course *Linear Regression and Modeling* and *R Programming*. You are welcomed to get connected with me via my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quinnhe/) and find more details on my past working experiences, skills, certificates and publications.

About this Repo
------------------------
This is a repo where I'll put my data analysis work samples documented with *R* and corresponding `.md` files. These samples can be: 

* Student Mentor work samples for certain courses on Coursera;   
* Data analysis reports for reproducing my published or working academic research papers;
* from data-driven projects that I participated as a student or research assistant;
* Products out of pure interest or for fun __QvQ__

__To view my work samples, please review the list in the following section and find the ones that interest you. To further review corresponding codes behind a certain work, please register for Github, fork this repo, find the link to the corresponding `.md` file in the list in your forked repo, and edit the work.__

__Any feedbacks on my works? You are welcomed to reach me at [kunyuhe@uchicago.com](kunyuhe@uchicago.com). You can also edit the documents directly in your forked repo and send me a pull request.__ Here is a [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for how to do so. I'll be glad to add you as a contributor to this project and maybe one day I'll change the name of this repo for you __;)__

__For Chinese users, if you would like to receive timely notice of this repo's further updates, you can follow my Wechat Official Account, `QuinninR`.__

__Thanks for reading and have a good day! =v=__
