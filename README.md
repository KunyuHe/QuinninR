# Where Everything Starts

About Myself
---------------------------
Hello, world! This is Quinn He. I'm a current senior student at Nanjing University, China and I'll become a M.A. candidate in [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.sites.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, IL this fall. I study both economics and international relations. I'm interested in applied economic research in the field of education and environmental politics. 

I work with data, and I feel most comfortable working with *R* and *RStudio*. I'm currently working for [Netease Game](http://game.163.com/en/) as a data analyst and I'm also volunteering at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) as a student mentor for the course *Linear Regression and Modeling* and *R Programming*. You can visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quinnhe/) for more details on my past working experiences, skills and publications.

About this Repo
------------------------
This is a repo where I'll put the `.md` files containing my data analysis work samples documented with *R*. These samples can be: 

* Student Mentor work samples for certain courses on Coursera;   
* Data analysis reports for reproducing my published or working academic research papers;
* from data-driven projects that I participated as a student or research assistant;
* Products out of pure interest or for fun

__To view my work samples, please review the list of my published `.md` files in the following section and find the ones that interest you. To further review corresponding codes behind a certain work, please register for Github, fork this repo, find the work again in your forked repo and click edit.__

Any feedbacks on my works? You are welcomed to reach me at [kunyuhe@uchicago.com](kunyuhe@uchicago.com). You can also edit the codes or the documents directly in your forked repo and send me a merge requirement.
