# Quinn's Statistics with R Work Sample

Where Everything Starts
========================================================

Hello, world! This is Quinn He. I'm a current senior student at Nanjing University, China and I'll become a M.A. candidate in [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.sites.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, IL this fall. I study both economics and international relations. I'm interested in applied economic research in the field of education and environmental politics. 

I work with data, and I feel most comfortable working with *R* and *RStudio*. I'm currently working for [Netease Game](http://game.163.com/en/) as a data analyst and I'm also volunteering at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) as a student mentor for the course *Linear Regression and Modeling* and *R Programming*. You can visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quinnhe/) for more details on my past working experiences, skills and publications.
