# Where Everything Starts

About Myself
---------------------------
Hello, world! This is Kunyu He. I'm a current M.S. student in [Computational Analysis & Public Policy](https://capp.sites.uchicago.edu/) at Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. I possess a BSc Economics from Nanjing University, with a second major in International Politics. I'm interested in data science with R & Python, applied economics and game theory. 

I work with data, and I feel most comfortable working with *R*. I'm volunteering at [Coursera Inc.](https://www.coursera.org/) as a student mentor for *R Programming*. I worked for [Netease Game Inc.](http://game.163.com/en/) as a Data Analyst Intern. You are welcomed to get connected with me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quinnhe/) and find more details on my past working experiences, skills, certificates and publications.

About this Repo
------------------------
This is a repo where I'll put my data analysis work samples documented with *R* and corresponding `.md` files. These samples can be: 

* Student Mentor work samples for certain courses on Coursera;   
* Data analysis reports for reproducing my published or working academic research papers;
* from data-driven projects that I participated as a student or research assistant;
* Products out of pure interest or for fun __QvQ__

__To view my work samples, please review the list in the following section and find the ones that interest you. To further review corresponding codes behind a certain work, please register for Github, fork this repo, find the link to the corresponding `.md` file in the list in your forked repo, and edit the work.__

__Any feedbacks on my works? You are welcomed to reach me at [kunyuheecon@gmail.com](kunyuheecon@gmail.com). You can also edit the documents directly in your forked repo and send me a pull request.__ Here is a [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for how to do so. I'll be glad to add you as a contributor to this project and maybe one day I'll change the name of this repo for you __;)__

__For Chinese users, if you would like to receive timely notice of this repo's further updates, you can follow my Wechat Official Account, `QuinninR`.__

__Thanks for reading and have a good day! =v=__
